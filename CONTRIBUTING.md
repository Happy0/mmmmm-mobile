# Contributor docs

## App uses these technologies:

- React Native
- Node.js Mobile
- Scuttlebot
- TypeScript
- Cycle.js with xstream
- Pull streams
- Patchcore (with depject)

## Install dependencies

### React Native specifics

Use node `v8.9.x` and npm `v5.6.x`, and follow the [official React Native docs](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html).

Also install the CLI:

```
npm install --global react-native-cli
```

### macOS specifics

If you are developing on a macOS, then you might need `realpath`, install it through coreutils:

```
brew update
brew install coreutils
```

### Android specifics

You need Android Studio and a recent Android SDK (installable through Android Studio).

You may need to open your app's `/android` folder in Android Studio, so that it detects, downloads and cofigures requirements that might be missing, like the NDK and CMake to build the native code part of the project.

You can also set the environment variable `ANDROID_NDK_HOME`, as in this example:

```
export ANDROID_NDK_HOME=/Users/username/Library/Android/sdk/ndk-bundle
```

Also check out [nodejs-mobile](https://github.com/janeasystems/nodejs-mobile) repository for the necessary prerequisites for your system.

This app only supports Android 5.0 and above.

### Manyverse specifics

```
npm install
```

## Build and run in development

You can run `npm run build-android-debug` which will run all the necessary scripts in order. Or run each step manually:

`1`: Compile TypeScript files

```
npm run lib
```

`2`: Propagate replacement modules throughout all dependencies using [propagate-replacement-fields](https://github.com/staltz/propagate-replacement-fields):
```
npm run propagate-replacements
```

`3`: Build the "backend" Node.js project (which runs Scuttlebot):

```
npm run build-nodejs-app
```

`4`: Build the Android apk:

```
react-native run-android
```

During step 5, another terminal may spawn with the React Native Metro bundler. The app should be installed automatically, if you have a device connected by USB. You can see the logs with `react-native log-android` or `adb logcat`.

### Continuous compilation

To watch source code files and continuously compile them, use three terminals:

- One terminal running `$(npm bin)/tsc --watch` to compile the TypeScript code
- One terminal running `npm run clean-bundler && npm start -- --reset-cache` for the Metro bundler
- One terminal where you can run `npm run build-android-debug` to build the APK

There is no support for continuously compiling the backend Node.js project.

### Troubleshooting

On Android applications, the `react-native` build process is sometimes unable to rebuild assets.
If you are getting errors while building the application using `react-native run-android`, then the command `npm run full-clean` can help you do a clean rebuild of the project. Then, reinstall with `npm install` and rebuild.

#### NullPointerException on `npm run build-nodejs-app`

If you see the error below while running the `build-nodejs-app` build script, you should try opening this project's `android` folder in android studio (using the `build.gradle` file to tell android studio it is a gradle project.) It should detect missing dependencies and give you the option to install them via the console window (and rebuild) at the bottom of the window.

A problem occurred configuring project ':app'.
> Could not resolve all dependencies for configuration ':app:_debugApk'.
   > A problem occurred configuring project ':nodejs-mobile-react-native'.
      > java.lang.NullPointerException (no error message)

```

## Integration tests

We use Appium and Tape, just plug in a device through USB and run `npm run test-e2e-android`. This will run tests on top of the *release* variant of the app, so it that doesn't exist, you must run `npm run build-android-release` first.

## Releases

To build a release APK, follow [these instructions](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/signed-apk-android.html), in short:

1. Put the correct file `my-release-key.keystore` in the folder `android/app/`
2. Configure the file `~/.gradle/gradle.properties` with the correct values
3. Run `cd android && ./gradlew assembleRelease` (just builds the APK) or `npm run release` (for official releases)
